# API Reference Overview

This section provides detailed documentation for all API endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "data": {
    // Response data specific to the endpoint
  },
  "meta": {
    "request_id": "req_123456",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-27T12:34:56Z"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and a JSON body:

```json

  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "The request was invalid",
    "details": [
      "Parameter 'name' is required"
